# NoveltyFeature

Calculates the novelty feature of audio.

NoveltyFeature is closely linked with NoveltySlice and exposes the underlying measure of novelty as a standalone audio descriptor. As a result it can be useful in understanding how the slicing object works at a lower-level, or as a feature in and of itself. Below is a plot that depicts the measurement of novelty across an oboe multiphonic audio sample.

NoveltyFeature object shares all the parameters that refer to the configuration of the algorithm as the NoveltySlice object. This does not include generic shared parameters such as Source, Features, Indices, etc.

The plot was calculated with the default parameters.
