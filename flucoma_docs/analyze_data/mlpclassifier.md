In machine learning, classification refers to an algorithm that is trained to predict what category, or class, an input belongs to. “MLP” stands for multi-layer perceptron which is a type of neural network.PointerFor more information on using this object, visit[MLP Training](/learn/mlp-training),[MLP Parameters](/learn/mlp-parameters), and[Training-Testing Split](/learn/training-testing-split)By providing input data as a[DataSet](/reference/dataset)and output labels as a[LabelSet](/reference/labelset), the neural network is trained using*supervised learning*so that it can predict the most probable label for a given data point input. See this[YouTube tutorial](/learn/classification-neural-network)where we train the MLPClassifier to classify oboe and trombone sounds in real-time.
