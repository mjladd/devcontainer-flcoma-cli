# BufScale

Buffer scaling

The BufScale object scales the values of data stored in a buffer and copies them to a new buffer. The interface is relatively lean: all you provide are minima and maxima for the input and output. Optionally you can clip the output, such that after the scaling is performed the numbers never exceed the provided output range. Use the widget below to see how the scaling process processes data.
